# Pentest Mapper #

Pentest Mapper is a Burp Suite extension that integrates the Burp Suite request logging with a custom application testing checklist. The extension provides a straightforward flow for application penetration testing. The extension includes functionalities to allow users to map the flow of the application for pentesting to better analyse the application and its vulnerabilities. The API calls from each flow can be connected with the function or flow name. The extension allows users to map or connect each flow or API to vulnerability with the custom checklist.
